"This module provides classes that produce realistic distortions of speech"
" data for the purpose of training speech processing models. The list of "
"distortions includes adding noise, adding reverberation, changing speed, "
"and more. All the classes are of type `torch.nn.Module`. This gives the "
"possibility to have end-to-end differentiability and backpropagate the "
"gradient through them. In addition, all operations are expected to be "
"performed on the GPU (where available) for efficiency."
