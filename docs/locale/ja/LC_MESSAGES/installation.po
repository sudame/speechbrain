"SpeechBrain is constantly evolving. New features, tutorials, and "
"documentation will appear over time. SpeechBrain can be installed via "
"PyPI to rapidly use the standard library. Moreover, a local installation "
"can be used to run experiments and modify/customize the toolkit."

"SpeechBrain supports both CPU and GPU computations. For most recipes, "
"however, a GPU is necessary during training. Please note that CUDA must "
"be properly installed to use GPUs."
